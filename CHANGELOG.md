### Added
- Reinstated the vendored **tree-sitter-rust** grammar (v0.25.3) with scanner support, editor utilities, CLI hooks, and benchmark coverage.

- Documented release workflow updates across README, CODEX, and TODO to guide RC1 preparation.

### Changed
- Upgraded the vendored Tree-sitter runtime headers to ABI version 15, aligning Grove with CLI/runtime 0.25.x expectations.
- Refreshed tooling, language registry, and tests to use the restored Rust grammar alongside JSON, Zig, Ghostlang, and TypeScript.
- Enhanced performance documentation to highlight both throughput (`zig build bench`) and latency guardrails.

### Pending
- Markdown grammar vendoring and fixtures (tracked for Week 4 deliverable).
- Python and JavaScript grammar onboarding for the Beta milestone.
