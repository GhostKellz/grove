# RFC 0000: [Title]

- **Start Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **RFC PR:** [Link to PR]
- **Grove Issue:** [Link to related issue, if any]

## Summary

[One paragraph explanation of the change]

## Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

Detail the problem you're trying to solve. This section should focus on:
- What's currently not possible or difficult
- Why existing solutions are insufficient
- How this change benefits Grove users
- Alignment with Grove's goals and philosophy

## Detailed Design

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with Grove to understand, and for somebody familiar with the implementation to implement.

### API Design

Show the proposed API with examples:

```zig
// Example API usage
const result = try grove.newFeature(options);
```

### Implementation Strategy

- How will this be implemented?
- What modules/files will be affected?
- Are there any special implementation considerations?

### Error Handling

- What errors can occur?
- How are they handled and reported?
- Error recovery strategies?

### Testing Strategy

- How will this feature be tested?
- Unit tests, integration tests, performance tests?
- Test coverage expectations?

### Documentation

- What documentation needs to be updated?
- New examples or tutorials needed?
- API reference changes?

## Backward Compatibility

- Is this a breaking change?
- If so, what's the migration strategy?
- How will existing code be affected?
- Deprecation timeline if applicable?

## Performance Implications

- Does this change affect performance?
- Memory usage implications?
- Computational complexity changes?
- Benchmarking strategy?

## Security Considerations

- Are there any security implications?
- Input validation requirements?
- Potential attack vectors?

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```zig
// Show basic usage example
const grove = @import("grove");

pub fn example() !void {
    // Your example here
}
```

### Advanced Usage

```zig
// Show more complex usage scenarios
// Include error handling
// Show integration with existing APIs
```

### Migration Example

If this is a breaking change, show before/after:

```zig
// Before (current API)
const old_result = grove.oldFunction(params);

// After (new API)
const new_result = try grove.newFunction(new_params);
```
